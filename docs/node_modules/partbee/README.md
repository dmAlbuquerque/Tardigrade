The simple way to use it is move `style` PartBee folder to you project. You can remove some folders if you want.

```
Project/
├── Demo/                       ~ You can remove this
│   └── { all demo files }
└── Content/Site/
    ├── css/                    ~ THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOLDER!
    └── scss/                   ~ You can remove this
```

If you want, you don't need to use compiled version and use `*.scss` files and change variables (`Content/Site/scss/base/_variable.scss`) to change color patterns in you PartBee framework version.
